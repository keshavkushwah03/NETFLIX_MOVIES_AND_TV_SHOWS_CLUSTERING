# NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING

Project Type: Unsupervised 

Author: Keshav Kushwah

## Project Summary

The aim of this project is to explore and cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their attributes, providing valuable insights into the content available on the platform. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships between the different titles, helping users discover content tailored to their preferences.

## Project Strategy

**Data Loading and Exploration:**

- The project began with loading the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, containing information about various titles available on Netflix.
- Initial data exploration involved examining the dataset's structure, checking for duplicate values, and identifying missing data.

**Data Preprocessing:**

- Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, converting date-related columns, and splitting the dataset into movies and TV shows.
- Additional data unnesting was performed to separate directors and cast members, enhancing the granularity of the dataset.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
- EDA involved creating visualizations and conducting statistical analyses to uncover patterns and trends.

**Feature Engineering:**

- Feature engineering included creating new features, such as date-related variables, to provide additional context for clustering.

**Clustering Analysis:**

- Unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, were applied to segment Netflix titles into distinct groups based on their attributes.
- Clustering algorithms, like K-Means or DBSCAN, were used to achieve this segmentation.
- Insights from the clustering analysis helped reveal commonalities and differences between content.

## Problem Statement

To enhance content recommendation and user personalization on Netflix, this project aims to cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their content attributes using unsupervised machine learning techniques, addressing the challenge of diverse and unstructured content data.

## Conclusion

**Conclusions from EDA**

- The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset has unveiled valuable insights:
    - Content Type Distribution
    - Content Ratings
    - Top Production Countries
    - Release Year Distribution
    - Title Keywords
    - Genre Prevalence
    - TV Show Seasons
    - Content Duration
    - Top Directors and Actors
    - Yearly and Monthly Additions

**Conclusion from ML Model**

- In this analysis, we explored and implemented clustering models, including K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN Clustering, on a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows.
